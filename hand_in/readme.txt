1. Run download.sh to download the require data
2. Run beer.py and / or cocktail.py to generate the text content for drinks in a csv
3. Once  the csvs have been generated, run their respective gen_beer.py or gen_cocktail py to generate their corresponding .idml files.

Note:
20 idml files will be generated by the script. These files will not be polished, and manual tweaking and selection is required at the moment.

Some of the generated cocktail idml files do not work - I suspect there is an issue with the script where I replace the image int he idml file.
